	abstract = {A simple parametric relationship is established between factors describing the shape of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation spectra and observable properties of the aerosol population they grow on (size distribution and solubility). This is done independently for maritime and continental aerosol types because of their very different characteristics. The data used for the multiple statistical adjustments in the procedure described in this paper are generated by running a numerical model of aerosol growth coupled to a simple cloud droplet activation scheme. Each aerosol population (maritime and continental) is assumed to be of homogeneous chemical composition, lognormally distributed and with variable solubility. The parameterization is then evaluated using a large set of aerosol populations with randomized properties. Finally, the study presents a preliminary analysis of the most important aerosol properties that influence the shape of the CCN spectra. An idealized scenario of a clean maritime boundary layer cloud perturbed by anthropogenic emissions (such as the ship track problem) illustrates the capability of the parameterization to selectively increase the cloud droplet concentration in a partially polluted cloud. The calibration results presented in this paper are not meant to be the definitive activation spectra produced by any lognormally distributed aerosols. These results are indeed a step toward an objective initialization of CCN spectra and hence toward the computation of cloud droplet concentrations based on measurable multimodal aerosol features, as required by three‐dimensional numerical models with a coupled interactive aerosol module.},

A new parameterization scheme is described for calculation of supersaturation in LES models that specifically aims at the simulation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation and prediction of the droplet number concentration. The scheme is tested against current parameterizations in the framework of the Meso-NH LES model. It is shown that the saturation adjustment scheme, based on parameterizations of CCN activation in a convective updraft, overestimates the droplet concentration in the cloud core, while it cannot simulate cloud top supersaturation production due to mixing between cloudy and clear air. A supersaturation diagnostic scheme mitigates these artefacts by accounting for the presence of already condensed water in the cloud core, but it is too sensitive to supersaturation fluctuations at cloud top and produces spurious CCN activation during cloud top mixing. The proposed pseudo-prognostic scheme shows performance similar to the diagnostic one in the cloud core but significantly mitigates CCN activation at cloud top.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Recent increases in computing power mean that atmospheric models for numerical weather prediction are now able to operate at grid spacings of the order of a few hundred meters, comparable to the dominant turbulence length scales in the atmospheric boundary layer. As a result, models are starting to partially resolve the coherent overturning structures in the boundary layer. In this resolution regime, the so‐called boundary layer “gray zone,” neither the techniques of high‐resolution atmospheric modeling (a few tens of meters resolution) nor those of traditional meteorological models (a few kilometers resolution) are appropriate because fundamental assumptions behind the parameterizations are violated. Nonetheless, model simulations in this regime may remain highly useful. In this paper, a newly formed gray zone boundary layer community lays the basis for parameterizing gray zone turbulence, identifies the challenges in high‐resolution atmospheric modeling and presents different gray zone boundary layer models. We discuss both the successful applications and the limitations of current parameterization approaches, and consider various issues in extending promising research approaches into use for numerical weather prediction. The ultimate goal of the research is the development of unified boundary layer parameterizations valid across all scales.

	abstract = {Abstract 
            A new parametrization is presented for the representation in large‐scale models of turbulent form drag due to subgrid orography with horizontal scales smaller than around 5000 m. The scheme is based on earlier work in which surface stress and its vertical distribution is formulated in terms of a slope parameter for sinusoidal hills. The new elements of the current parametrization are: (i) the spectrum of the orography is represented by a piecewise empirical power law, (ii) the turbulent form drag scheme integrates over the spectral orography to represent all the relevant scales, and (iii) the wind forcing level of the drag scheme depends on the horizontal scale of the orography, which implies that the smaller scales respond to lighter winds than do the larger scales. 
            The scheme is controlled by a single parameter, namely the spectral density of the orography at scales of a few kilometres, as can be accurately obtained from a global 1 km data set. The empirical orographic power‐law spectrum is derived by analysing fine resolution data as available for the USA. In order to be applicable in a large‐scale model, simplifications are applied. Single‐column simulations are performed to assess the consequences of these simplifications. Comparisons of single‐column simulations with output from fine‐scale simulations for sinusoidal hills show that the approximations are within the uncertainty of the fine‐scale models. Furthermore, it is felt that the scheme is sufficiently accurate given the uncertainty in the characterization of the orography with current global datasets. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2004.

Two wildland fire behavior case studies were elaborated and used as a basis to test the simulator. Both fires were reconstructed, paying attention to the vegetation mapping, fire history, and meteorological data. The local calibration of the simulator required the development of appropriate fuel models for shrubland vegetation (maquis) for use with the model of fire spread. This study showed the capabilities of the simulator during the typical drought season characterizing the Mediterranean climate when most wildfires occur.},

Results are expressed as NO produced per meter of arc length, and are measured as functions of dissipated energy and of peak current. It is found that at atmospheric pressure, the NO production per joule of dissipated energy is not constant.

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Linear theory and numerical simulations are used to investigate gap flows. Both gaps embedded in a long mountain ridge and gaps located between two isolated mountain peaks are considered. The study mainly focuses on level gaps so as to isolate three‐dimensional effects from two‐dimensional gravity‐wave propagation. Special attention is given to qualitative differences between the linear and the nonlinear flow regimes, the linear regime being defined by the absence of gravity‐wave breaking. 
            In the linear regime, wind and pressure perturbations along a level gap axis are found to be qualitatively similar to those over a mountain ridge or peak, but of lower amplitude and longer horizontal wavelength. They are caused by vertically propagating gravity waves radiating from the mountain ridges (peaks) towards the gap axis and by low‐level confluence within the gap. In the nonlinear regime, however, these two processes are of minor importance due to upstream blocking and low‐level wave breaking. Instead, the pressure difference across the mountain ridge primarily drives the gap flow, which tends to be decoupled from the flow over the adjacent ridge. In contrast to the linear regime, gap winds are as strong as or even stronger than the winds over the mountain ridge. Surface friction is found to reduce the near‐surface wind speed more strongly for mountain ridges than for gaps. Copyright © 2002 Royal Meteorological Society.},

              The internal circulation and the shape of water drops falling at terminal velocity in air of 20°C at sea level pressure, and nearly water saturated, were studied by means of a wind tunnel. Drops with an equivalent radius a

              ≤ 500 μm were slightly deformed into an oblate spheroid. The deviation of these drops from spherical shape was found to be in fair agreement with that theoretically predicted by Imai (1950) and others. The deformation of drops of sizes 0.5 mm {\textless} a

            By means of a tracer technique it was established that water drops falling at terminal velocity in air have a well developed internal circulation. The flow pattern inside a drop was found to be consistent with the flow pattern of the air around the drop and that predicted theoretically by Hadamard (1911) and by Hamielec and Johnson (1962). The surface velocity at the equator of a drop was found to be about 1/100 of the drop's terminal velocity. The experimentally determined internal velocities were compared with those predicted theoretically by McDonald (1954) from boundary layer theory and by Hadamard (1911) based on Stokes flow.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Urban canopy models (UCMs) represent the exchange of momentum, heat, and moisture between cities and the atmosphere. Single-layer UCMs interact with the lowest atmospheric model level and are suited for low- to mid-rise cities, whereas multi-layer UCMs interact with multiple levels and can also be employed for high-rise cities. The present study describes the multi-layer coupling between the Town Energy Balance (TEB) UCM included in the Surface Externalisée (SURFEX) land surface model and the Meso-NH mesoscale atmospheric model. This is a step towards better high-resolution weather prediction for urban areas in the future and studies quantifying the impact of climate change adaptation measures in high-rise cities. The effect of the buildings on the wind is considered using a drag force and a production term in the prognostic equation for turbulent kinetic energy. The heat and moisture fluxes from the walls and the roofs to the atmosphere are released at the model levels intersecting these urban facets. No variety of building height at grid-point scale is considered to remain the consistency between the modification of the Meso-NH equations and the geometric assumptions of TEB. The multi-layer coupling is evaluated for the heterogeneous high-rise, high-density city of Hong Kong. It leads to a strong improvement of model results for near-surface air temperature and relative humidity, which is due to better consideration of the process of horizontal advection in the urban canopy layer. For wind speed, model results are improved on average by the multi-layer coupling but not for all stations. Future developments of the multi-layer SURFEX-TEB will focus on improving the calculation of radiative exchanges, which will allow a variety of building heights at grid-point scale to be taken into account.},

            The simulations of five midlatitude precipitating events by the nonhydrostatic mesoscale model Méso-NH are analyzed. These cases cover contrasted precipitation situations from 30° to 60°N, which are typical of midlatitudes. They include a frontal case with light precipitation over the Rhine River area (10 February 2000), a long-lasting precipitation event at Hoek van Holland, Netherlands (19 September 2001), a moderate rain case over the Elbe (12 August 2002), an intense rain case over Algiers (10 November 2001), and the “millennium storm” in the United Kingdom (30 October 2000). The physically consistent hydrometeor and thermodynamic outputs are used to generate a database for cloud and precipitation retrievals. The hydrometeor vertical profiles that were generated vary mostly with the 0°C isotherm, located between 1 and 3 km in height depending on the case. The characteristics of this midlatitude database are complementary to the GPROF database, which mostly concentrates on tropical situations. The realism of the simulations is evaluated against satellite observations by comparing synthetic brightness temperatures (BTs) with Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), and Meteosat observations. The good reproduction of the BT distributions by the model is exploited by calculating categorical scores for verification purposes. The comparison with 3-hourly Meteosat observations demonstrates the ability of the model to forecast the time evolution of the cloud cover, the latter being better predicted for the stratiform cases than for others. The comparison with AMSU-B measurements shows the skill of the model to predict rainfall at the correct location.},

            A full radar simulator for high-resolution (1–5 km) nonhydrostatic models has been developed within the research nonhydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric (Meso-NH) model. This simulator is made up of building blocks, each of which describes a particular physical process (scattering, beam bending, etc.). For each of these blocks, several formulations have been implemented. For instance, the radar simulator offers the possibility to choose among Rayleigh, Rayleigh–Gans, Mie, or T-matrix scattering methods, and beam bending can be derived from an effective earth radius or can depend on the vertical gradient of the refractive index of air. Moreover, the radar simulator is fully consistent with the microphysical parameterizations used by the atmospheric numerical model. 
            Sensitivity experiments were carried out using different configurations for the simulator. They permitted the specification of an observation operator for assimilation of radar reflectivities by high-resolution nonhydrostatic numerical weather prediction systems, as well as for their validation. A study of the flash flood of 8–9 September 2002 in southeastern France, which was well documented with volumetric data from an S-band radar, serves to illustrate the capabilities of the radar simulator as a validation tool for a mesoscale model.},

Méso‐NH is applied here to the extreme flash flood event of 8–9 September 2002 in southeastern France.

              Kinetic energy (KE) spectra are applied to evaluate two convection‐permitting models: the AROME numerical weather prediction operational model and the Meso‐NH research model, that share the same physics and differ only in the dynamics (semi‐Lagrangian semi‐implicit 
              versus 
              Eulerian explicit schemes). 
             
             
              A first analysis of AROME spectra for winter and summer seasons shows that the model‐derived spectra match the observational spectra well, including the transition between k 
              -3 
              and k 
              -5/3 
              regimes. The vertical distribution of the spectra is coherent with previous observational and numerical studies and the diurnal cycle has a strong impact on the amount of KE in the mesoscale during summer. 
             
            A comparative analysis of KE spectra for both models is then performed on a real case of individual convective cells that developed over plains, during the afternoon of 11 April 2007, characterized by a strong cold air outflow in the low levels. 
            AROME spectra are characterized by a coarser effective resolution than Meso‐NH, even without explicit diffusion, revealing the impact of the implicit diffusion of the semi‐implicit semi‐Lagrangian scheme used in AROME. For large time steps, the damping increases and can be attributed preferentially to the SI part of the SISL (semi‐implicit semi‐Lagrangian) formulation. Adiabatic runs show that the transition to a shallow mesoscale regime is still apparent even if the mesoscale KE variance strongly depends on the presence of the physical processes. 
             
              Effective resolution of Meso‐NH remains around 4–6Δ 
              x 
              for horizontal grid spacings between 2.5 km and 250 m. The effects of subgrid mixing schemes are also investigated with Meso‐NH at 500 m horizontal grid spacing in the grey zone for turbulence, illustrating the difficulty in finding a good equilibrium between resolved and subgrid mixing at this scale.},

Both approaches have particular capabilities and interests: the sectional approach is able to describe every kind of distribution, whereas the lognormal one makes assumption of the distribution form with a fewer number of explicit variables. For this last reason we developed a three‐moment lognormal aerosol scheme named ORILAM to be coupled in three‐dimensional mesoscale or CTM models. This paper presents the concept and hypothesis of a range of aerosol processes such as nucleation, coagulation, condensation, sedimentation, and dry deposition. One particular interest of ORILAM is to keep explicit the aerosol composition and distribution (mass of each constituent, mean radius, and standard deviation of the distribution are explicit) using the prediction of three‐moment (m0, m3, and m6). The new model was evaluated by comparing simulations to measurements from the Escompte campaign and to a previously published aerosol model. The numerical cost of the lognormal mode is lower than two bins of the sectional one.},

	abstract = {Several studies have shown the importance of aerosols in the Earth's radiative balance. The radiative effect of dust has earlier been quantified in global and regional climate models. Fewer studies have included prediction of aerosols online in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Predicting climate effect of aerosols is different from including aerosols actively in weather prediction because climate models give average responses over long timescales, whereas the purpose of weather prediction models is to calculate the right weather on short timescales. In this paper, we run a mesoscale NWP with four different assumptions on dust aerosols: (1) no dust, (2) climatological data set for dust aerosols, (3) forecasted dust using the Dust Entrainment and Deposition model (DEAD) and (4) same as assumption 3 but with decreased single scattering albedo. We show that the assumption on dust is important for predicting ground temperature and convective precipitation in the model. Dust changes the model physics through changing the radiative fluxes. We interpret the changes through analyzing the energy budgets for four zones close to the major dust sources. The zones include both convective and nonconvective areas. In convective areas over ocean, dust can decrease convective activity. The vertical gradient of the aerosols and their single scattering albedo determine how efficient they are. Over land, dust also influences the surface energy budget so that decreased latent heat fluxes result if dust plumes pass over areas where water evaporates from the surface.},

	abstract = {Abstract. A complete chemical module has been developed for use in the Meso-NH three-dimensional cloud resolving mesoscale model. This module includes gaseous- and aqueous-phase chemical reactions that are analysed by a pre-processor generating the Fortran90 code automatically. The kinetic solver is based on a Rosenbrock algorithm, which is robust and accurate for integrating stiff systems and especially multiphase chemistry. The exchange of chemical species between the gas phase and cloud droplets and raindrops is computed kinetically by mass transfers considering non-equilibrium between the gas- and the condensed phases. Microphysical transfers of chemical species are considered for the various cloud microphysics schemes available, which are based on one-moment or two-moment schemes. The pH of the droplets and of the raindrops is diagnosed separately as the root of a high order polynomial equation. The chemical concentrations in the ice phase are modelled in a single phase encompassing the two categories of precipitating ice particles (snow and graupel) of the microphysical scheme. The only process transferring chemical species in ice is retention during freezing or riming of liquid hydrometeors. Three idealized simulations are reported, which highlight the sensitivity of scavenging efficiency to the choice of the microphysical scheme and the retention coefficient in the ice phase. A two-dimensional warm, shallow convection case is used to compare the impact of the microphysical schemes on the temporal evolution and rates of acid precipitation. Acid wet deposition rates are shown to be overestimated when a one-moment microphysics scheme is used compared to a two-moment scheme. The difference is induced by a better prediction of raindrop radius and raindrop number concentration in the latter scheme. A two-dimensional mixed-phase squall line and a three-dimensional mixed-phase supercell were simulated to test the sensitivity of cloud vertical transport to the retention efficiency of gases in the ice phase. The 2-D and 3-D simulations illustrate that the retention in ice of a moderately soluble gas such as formaldehyde substantially decreases its concentration in the upper troposphere. In these simulations, retention of highly soluble species in the ice phase significantly increased the wet deposition rates.},

	abstract = {Abstract. A lightning NOx (LiNOx) source has been implemented in the deep convection scheme of the Meso-NH mesoscale model following a mass-flux formalism coherent with the transport and scavenging of gases inside the convective scheme. In this approach the vertical transport of NO inside clouds is calculated by the parameterization of deep convective transport, thus eliminating the need for a-priori LiNOx profiles. Once produced inside the convective column, NO molecules are redistributed by updrafts and downdrafts and detrained in the environment when the conditions are favorable. The model was applied to three particular flights during the Tropical Convection, Cirrus and Nitrogen Oxides (TROCCINOX) campaign over the tropical area around Bauru on 3–4 March 2004. The convective activity during the three flights was investigated using brightness temperature at 10.7 :math:`mu` m observed from GOES-12 satellite. The use of a model-to-satellite approach reveals that the simulation appears rather realistic compared to the observations. The diurnal cycle of the simulated brightness temperature, CAPE, number of IC flashes, NO entrainment flux are in phase, with a succession of three marked peaks at 18:00 UTC (15:00 LT). These simulated peaks precede the observed afternoon one by about three hours. Comparison of the simulated NOx with observations along the flight tracks show that the model reproduces well the observed NOx levels when the LiNOx source is applied. The budget of entrainment, detrainment and LiNOx convective fluxes shows that the majority of the NO detrained back to the environment comes from lightning source inside the convective columns. Entrainment of NO from the environment and vertical transport from the boundary layer were not significant during the episode. The troposphere is impacted by detrainment fluxes of LiNOx from 4 km altitude to 16 km with maximum values around 14 km altitude. Detrainment fluxes vary between 75 kg(N)/s during nighttime to 400 kg(N)/s at the times of maximun convective activity. Extrapolation of the regional LiNOx source would yield a global LiNOx production around 5.7 Tg(N)/year which is within the current estimates but should not hide the overestimation of the number of flash rates by the model.},

A brief presentation of the model is made that covers in particular the on‐line coupling capability for calculating meteorological and chemical concentration fields at each time step. Then, emphasis is put upon the simulation of transboundary pollution fluxes from London to northern France in a zone of large horizontal wind gradients. Comparison with data from the French Agence De l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME) pollution network indicates that ozone concentrations and time of arrival of the pollution plume are correctly predicted at surface stations in northern France. A sensitivity analysis relying upon local ozone production and pollution transport has shown that ∼30\% of ozone maxima levels could be attributed to regional transboundary fluxes.},

	abstract = {A model that predicts secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation based on the thermodynamic equilibrium partitioning of secondary organic oxidation products has been developed for implementation into atmospheric models. Hydrophobic secondary products are assumed to partition to an absorbing organic aerosol consisting of primary organic aerosol (POA) and other secondary hydrophobic organics according to an equilibrium partitioning coefficient calculated iteratively for each secondary compound present. The hydrophobic module is evaluated by studying the partitioning of octadecanoic acid to surrogate POA species. As expected, the amount of octadecanoic acid predicted to be present in the aerosol phase increases as the total amount of absorbing material increases or as the total amount of acid present increases. Hydrophilic secondary compounds partition to an aqueous phase via Henry's law; the fraction of each compound's mass that partitions is determined by its Henry's law constant and its acid dissociation constant(s). The available liquid water content (LWC) of the aerosol is determined iteratively between an inorganic aerosol module and the hydrophilic module, which is evaluated by studying the partitioning of glyoxalic and malic acids. While glyoxalic acid tends to remain in the gas phase, malic acid partitions strongly to the aqueous phase, with ions being the dominant form in the aqueous phase. As expected, an increase in relative humidity increases the amount of water associated with the organics (ΔLWC), and a lower aerosol pH favors molecular solutes over ionized forms. Increasing pH results in higher effective Henry's law constants for the acids, yielding higher organic aerosol concentrations. Results also indicate that increasing ΔLWC induces additional partitioning of inorganics to the aqueous phase.},

The new model uses a bimodal lognormal distribution to represent particles in the submicrometer size range. In addition to including the horizontal and vertical advection and vertical diffusion of the aerosol number concentration and sulfate mass concentration fields, the model now explicitly treats the response of the distribution parameters to particle coagulation within and between the modes, condensation of sulfate vapor onto existing particles, formation of new particles, evaporation and condensation of ambient water vapor in the presence of ammonia, and particle‐size‐dependent dry deposition. The model has been used to study how the degree of sulfuric acid neutralization by ambient ammonia affects the total aerosol concentrations and particle size distributions over eastern North America. Preliminary results for three representative locations, rural, near‐source, and nominal downwind of source, show that the effect is greatest for the rural and smallest for the near‐source regions, which corresponds with the largest and smallest values, respectively, of ammonium‐to‐sulfate molar ratios. The results indicate that the model could provide a tool for investigating the effects of various pollution control strategies, as well as new or alternative formulations of important aerosol processes.},

The ozone chemistry in the mechanism draws upon the recent work by simulating gas‐phase concentrations in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) of California over the period 27–29 August 1987. Total predicted concentrations of gas‐phase SOA compounds are compared with levels of SOA that have been inferred on the basis of ambient organic aerosol measurements during this period. These predicted concentrations indicate that the total gas‐phase potential of SOA‐forming compounds can account for observed aerosol concentrations.

	abstract = {Abstract. The paper describes the fully parallelized electrical scheme CELLS which is suitable to simulate explicitly electrified storm systems on parallel computers. Our motivation here is to show that a cloud electricity scheme can be developed for use on large grids with complex terrain. Large computational domains are needed to perform real case meteorological simulations with many independent convective cells.  The scheme computes the bulk electric charge attached to each cloud particle and hydrometeor. Positive and negative ions are also taken into account. Several parametrizations of the dominant non-inductive charging process are included and an inductive charging process as well. The electric field is obtained by inverting the Gauss equation with an extension to terrain-following coordinates. The new feature concerns the lightning flash scheme which is a simplified version of an older detailed sequential scheme. Flashes are composed of a bidirectional leader phase (vertical extension from the triggering point) and a phase obeying a fractal law (with horizontal extension on electrically charged zones). The originality of the scheme lies in the way the branching phase is treated to get a parallel code.  The complete electrification scheme is tested for the 10 July 1996 STERAO case and for the 21 July 1998 EULINOX case. Flash characteristics are analysed in detail and additional sensitivity experiments are performed for the STERAO case. Although the simulations were run for flat terrain conditions, they show that the model behaves well on multiprocessor computers. This opens a wide area of application for this electrical scheme with the next objective of running real meterological case on large domains.},

Application of the parameterization in a regional model during a 30‐day period of the Tropical Convection, Cirrus and Nitrogen Oxides (TROCCINOX) experiment over southern Brazil demonstrates a clear improvement in the representation of the cloud fields. The subgrid cloud parameterization significantly reduces both the biases and phase between the observed and simulated brightness temperatures in the thermal infrared band and the observed and simulated precipitation intensities, resulting in an improved representation of the diurnal cycle of convection over land. The strong impact on the diurnal cycle is mainly a consequence of reduced surface fluxes due to cloud shading and a change in tropospheric stability due to additional condensation/sublimation.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The paper describes the LIMA (Liquid Ice Multiple Aerosols) quasi two-moment microphysical scheme, which relies on the prognostic evolution of an aerosol population, and the careful description of the nucleating properties that enable cloud droplets and pristine ice crystals to form from aerosols. Several modes of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice freezing nuclei (IFN) are considered individually. A special class of partially soluble IFN is also introduced. These "aged" IFN act first as CCN and then as IFN by immersion nucleation at low temperatures. All the CCN modes are in competition with each other, as expressed by the single equation of maximum supersaturation. The IFN are insoluble aerosols that nucleate ice in several ways (condensation, deposition and immersion freezing) assuming the singular hypothesis. The scheme also includes the homogeneous freezing of cloud droplets, the Hallett–Mossop ice multiplication process and the freezing of haze at very low temperatures. LIMA assumes that water vapour is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the population of cloud droplets (adjustment to saturation in warm clouds). In ice clouds, the prediction of the number concentration of the pristine ice crystals is used to compute explicit deposition and sublimation rates (leading to free under/supersaturation over ice). The autoconversion, accretion and self-collection processes shape the raindrop spectra. The initiation of the large crystals and aggregates category is the result of the depositional growth of large crystals beyond a critical size. Aggregation and riming are computed explicitly. Heavily rimed crystals (graupel) can experience a dry or wet growth mode. An advanced version of the scheme includes a separate hail category of particles forming and growing exclusively in the wet growth mode. The sedimentation of all particle types is included. The LIMA scheme is inserted into the Meso-NH cloud-resolving mesoscale model. The flexibility of LIMA is illustrated by two 2-D experiments. The first one highlights the sensitivity of orographic ice clouds to IFN types and IFN concentrations. Then a squall line case discusses the microstructure of a mixed-phase cloud and the impacts of pure CCN and IFN polluting plumes. The experiments show that LIMA responds well to the complex nature of aerosol–cloud interactions, leading to different pathways for cloud and precipitation formation.},

The numerical representation of each process has been reviewed throughout and specific tests have been made to evaluate separately the accuracy of the scheme compared with a bin‐size model. The scheme, which depends on the specification of a few input parameters shaping the activation spectrum, is incorporated in a three‐dimensional non‐hydrostatic model with some applications given in a companion paper (Part II).},

	abstract = {A rapid and accurate radiative transfer model (RRTM) for climate applications has been developed and the results extensively evaluated. The current version of RRTM calculates fluxes and cooling rates for the longwave spectral region (10–3000 cm 
              -1 
              ) for an arbitrary clear atmosphere. The molecular species treated in the model are water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, and the common halocarbons. The radiative transfer in RRTM is performed using the correlated‐ 
              k 
              method: the 
              k 
              distributions are attained directly from the LBLRTM line‐by‐line model, which connects the absorption coefficients used by RRTM to high‐resolution radiance validations done with observations. Refined methods have been developed for treating bands containing gases with overlapping absorption, for the determination of values of the Planck function appropriate for use in the correlated‐ 
              k 
              approach, and for the inclusion of minor absorbing species in a band. The flux and cooling rate results of RRTM are linked to measurement through the use of LBLRTM, which has been substantially validated with observations. Validations of RRTM using LBLRTM have been performed for the midlatitude summer, tropical, midlatitude winter, subarctic winter, and four atmospheres from the Spectral Radiance Experiment campaign. On the basis of these validations the longwave accuracy of RRTM for any atmosphere is as follows: 0.6 W m 
              -2 
              (relative to LBLRTM) for net flux in each band at all altitudes, with a total (10–3000 cm 
              -1 
              ) error of less than 1.0 W m 
              -2 
              at any altitude; 0.07 K d 
              -1 
              for total cooling rate error in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, and 0.75 K d 
              -1 
              in the upper stratosphere and above. Other comparisons have been performed on RRTM using LBLRTM to gauge its sensitivity to changes in the abundance of specific species, including the halocarbons and carbon dioxide. The radiative forcing due to doubling the concentration of carbon dioxide is attained with an accuracy of 0.24 W m 
              -2 
              , an error of less than 5\%. The speed of execution of RRTM compares favorably with that of other rapid radiation models, indicating that the model is suitable for use in general circulation models.},

            A bulk mass‐flux convection parametrization for deep and shallow convection is presented that includes an efficient and straightforward treatment of numerics, moist thermodynamics and convective downdraughts.

Preliminary applications in a global numerical weather‐prediction model and a mesoscale model are also discussed. 
            The results suggest that the present scheme provides reasonable solutions in terms of predicted rainfall, and tropical temperature and moisture structures. The application of the scheme to various scales is supported by the use of a convective available potential energy convective closure that assures a smooth interaction with the large‐scale environment and efficiently suppresses conditional instability of the second kind‐like spin‐up processes on the grid‐scale. 
            Finally, the theoretical and practical limits of the present approach are discussed together with possible future developments.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The overall objective of the present study is to introduce the new ECOCLIMAP-II database for Europe, which is an upgrade for this region of the former initiative, ECOCLIMAP-I, already implemented at global scale. The ECOCLIMAP programme is a dual database at 1 km resolution that includes an ecosystem classification and a coherent set of land surface parameters that are primarily mandatory in meteorological modelling (notably leaf area index and albedo). Hence, the aim of this innovative physiography is to enhance the quality of initialisation and impose some surface attributes within the scope of weather forecasting and climate related studies. The strategy for implementing ECOCLIMAP-II is to depart from prevalent land cover products such as CLC2000 (Corine Land Cover) and GLC2000 (Global Land Cover) by splitting existing classes into new classes that possess a better regional character by virtue of the climatic environment (latitude, proximity to the sea, topography). The leaf area index (LAI) from MODIS and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from SPOT/Vegetation (a global monitoring system of vegetation) yield the two proxy variables that were considered here in order to perform a multi-year trimmed analysis between 1999 and 2005 using the K-means method. Further, meteorological applications require each land cover type to appear as a partition of fractions of 4 main surface types or tiles (nature, water bodies, sea, urban areas) and, inside the nature tile, fractions of 12 plant functional types (PFTs) representing generic vegetation types – principally broadleaf forest, needleleaf forest, C3 and C4 crops, grassland and bare land – as incorporated by the SVAT model ISBA (Interactions Surface Biosphere Atmosphere) developed at Météo France. This landscape division also forms the cornerstone of a validation exercise. The new ECOCLIMAP-II can be verified with auxiliary land cover products at very fine and coarse resolutions by means of versatile land occupation nomenclatures.},

	abstract = {A simple eddy kinetic energy parameterization of the oceanic vertical mixing is presented. The parameterization scheme is based on recent works on atmospheric turbulence modeling. It is designed to simulate vertical mixing at all depths, from the upper boundary layer down to the abyss. This scheme includes a single prognostic equation for the turbulent kinetic energy. The computation of the turbulent length scales is diagnostic, rather than prognostic. In weakly turbulent regions the simulated vertical diffusivity is inversely proportional to the Brunt‐Vaïsala frequency. In the first validation experiments presented here, the vertical mixing scheme is embedded into a simple one‐dimensional model and used for upper ocean simulations at two very different test sites: the station Papa in the Gulf of Alaska and the Long‐Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) mooring in the Sargasso Sea. At station Papa the model successfully simulates the seasonal evolution of the upper ocean temperature field. At LOTUS the focus is on a short 2‐week period. A detailed analysis of the oceanic heat budget during that period reveals a large bias in the bulk‐derived surface heat fluxes. After correction of the fluxes the model does well in simulating the evolution of the temperature and wind‐driven current. In particular, the large observed diurnal cycles of the sea surface temperature are well reproduced. During the second (windy) week of the selected period the model accounts for about two thirds of the kinetic energy of the observed upper ocean currents at periods larger than 6 hours. The local wind forcing thus appears to be the dominant generation mechanism for the near‐inertial motions, which are the most energetic. The velocity simulation is especially good at the low frequencies. During the second simulated week the model accounts for as much as 78\% of the kinetic energy at subinertial frequencies. The simulated mean velocity profile is reminiscent of an Ekman spiral, in agreement with the observations.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Meso-NH Atmospheric Simulation System is a joint effort of the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques and Laboratoire d'Aérologie. It comprises several elements; a numerical model able to simulate the atmospheric motions, ranging from the large meso-alpha scale down to the micro-scale, with a comprehensive physical package, a flexible file manager, an ensemble of facilities to prepare initial states, either idealized or interpolated from meteorological analyses or forecasts, a flexible post-processing and graphical facility to visualize the results, and an ensemble of interactive procedures to control these functions. Some of the distinctive features of this ensemble are the following: the model is currently based on the Lipps and Hemler form of the anelastic system, but may evolve towards a more accurate form of the equations system. In the future, it will allow for simultaneous simulation of several scales of motion, by the so-called "interactive grid-nesting technique". It allows for the in-line computation and accumulation of various terms of the budget of several quantities. It allows for the transport and diffusion of passive scalars, to be coupled with a chemical module. It uses the relatively new Fortran 90 compiler. It is tailored to be easily implemented on any UNIX machine. Meso-NH is designed as a research tool for small and meso-scale atmospheric processes. It is freely accessible to the research community, and we have tried to make it as "user-friendly" as possible, and as general as possible, although these two goals sometimes appear contradictory. The present paper presents a general description of the adiabatic formulation and some of the basic validation simulations. A list of the currently available physical parametrizations and initialization methods is also given. A more precise description of these aspects will be provided in a further paper.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            The response of the oceanic surface layer to atmospheric shallow convection is explored using realistic atmospheric large eddy simulations coupled with an oceanic 1D model with high vertical resolution. The effects of cloud shading, rain, and enhanced heat loss due to gust fronts on the edge of cold pools and their interactions are investigated in a case study of the Cooperative Indian Ocean Experiment on Intraseasonal Variability/Dynamics of the Madden–Julian Oscillation experiment in the tropical Indian Ocean, during a suppressed phase of the Madden–Julian Oscillation. Conditions of low surface wind and strong solar heating result in diurnal warming of the oceanic surface of  2 °C over a depth of 1 m. Analysis of specific periods covering the diurnal cycle shows the contrasting effects of cloud shading, rain, and turbulent heat fluxes under the cold pools on the sea temperature at the surface and below. On the one hand, decreasing the solar radiation (cloud shading) results in slight cooling extended horizontally and penetrating down to 1–2 m depth, depending on the time of the day. On the other hand, turbulent heat fluxes enhanced up to 300 Wm by gusts and freshwater lenses due to rain act together and more locally. They isolate and strongly cool a thin inner layer at the surface, which eventually destabilizes the surface layer and propagates the cooling downward. The exact relative part and efficiency of these processes depend on the time evolution of the thermal stratification and vertical turbulent mixing in the oceanic upper layer. Surface cooling of up to 0.5 °C may occur in a few tens of minutes and last for several hours, significantly mitigating the effects of diurnal warming over large extents.},

	abstract = {Abstract. A widely applicable parameterisation of turbulent heat and momentum fluxes at sea has been developed for the SURFEX v8.1 surface model. This wave-age-dependent stress parameterisation (WASP) combines a close fit to available in situ observations at sea up to wind speed of 60 m s-1 with the possibility of activating the impact of wave growth on the wind stress. It aims in particular at representing the effect of surface processes that depend on the surface wind according to the state of the art. It can be used with the different atmospheric models coupled with the surface model SURFEX, including the CNRM-CM climate model, the operational (numerical weather prediction) systems in use at Météo-France, and the research model Meso-NH. Designed to be used in coupled or forced mode with a wave model, it can also be used in an atmosphere-only configuration. It has been validated and tested in several case studies covering different surface conditions known to be sensitive to the representation of surface turbulent fluxes: (i) the impact of a sea surface temperature (SST) front on low-level flow by weak wind, (ii) the simulation of a Mediterranean heavy precipitating event where waves are known to influence the low-level wind and displace precipitation, (iii) several tropical cyclones, and (iv) a climate run over 35 years. It shows skills comparable to or better than the different parameterisations in use in SURFEX v8.1 so far.},

The stress turns out to be quadratically related to the 10-m wind speed and linearly to the wind speed at a wavelength related level. The Charnock parameter (dimensionless roughness length) shows a pronounced correlation with wave age. This implies, due to a coupling between wave age and the steepness of the waves, a connection between the stress and the steepness. We find that our North Sea results are consistent withopen ocean observations. For a given wind speed the mean stress at MPN turns out to be higher because the wave age there is in general lower. We define and give an expression for a drag coefficient at a wavelength related level that can be calculated straightforwardly from the wave age and then reduced to a standard level.},

	abstract = {Abstract It is proposed that the sea surface roughness zo can be predicted from the height and steepness of the waves, zo/Hs = A(Hs/Lp)B, where Hs and Lp are the significant wave height and peak wavelength for the combined sea and swell spectrum; best estimates for the coefficients are A = 1200, B = 4.5. The proposed formula is shown to predict well the magnitude and behavior of the drag coefficient as observed in wave tanks, lakes, and the open ocean, thus reconciling observations that previously had appeared disparate. Indeed, the formula suggests that changes in roughness due to limited duration or fetch are of order 10\% or less. Thus all deep water, pure windseas, regardless of fetch or duration, extract momentum from the air at a rate similar to that predicted for a fully developed sea. This is confirmed using published field data for a wide range of conditions over lakes and coastal seas. Only for field data corresponding to extremely young waves (U10/cp {\textgreater} 3) were there appreciable differences between the predicted and observed roughness values, the latter being larger on average. Significant changes in roughness may be caused by shoaling or by swell. A large increase in roughness is predicted for shoaling waves if the depth is less than about 0.2Lp. The presence of swell in the open ocean acts, on average, to significantly decrease the effective wave steepness and hence the mean roughness compared to that for a pure windsea. Thus the predicted open ocean roughness is, at most wind speeds, significantly less than is observed for pure wind waves on lakes. Only at high wind speeds, such that the windsea dominates the swell, do the mean open ocean values reach those for a fully developed sea.},

In order to explore and better understand the impact of OWA interactions on tropical cyclone modeling, a fully coupled OWA system based on the atmospheric model Meso-NH, the oceanic model CROCO, and the wave model WW3 and called MSWC was designed and applied to the case of tropical cyclone Bejisa (2013–2014). The fully coupled OWA simulation shows good agreement with the literature and available observations. In particular, simulated signiﬁcant wave height is within 30 cm of measurements made with buoys and altimeters. Short-term ({\textless} 2 days) sensitivity experiments used to highlight the effect of oceanic waves coupling show limited impact on the track, the intensity evolution, and the turbulent surface ﬂuxes of the tropical cyclone. However, it is also shown that using a fully coupled OWA system is essential to obtain consistent sea salt emissions. Spatial and temporal coherence of the sea state with the 10 m wind speed are necessary to produce sea salt aerosol emissions in the right place (in the eyewall of the tropical cyclone) and with the right size distribution, which is critical for cloud microphysics.},
