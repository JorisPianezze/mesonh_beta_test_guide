Two dimensional (cross-section xz or yz) with ideal surface
==================================================================

2D simulation is a powerful compromise between 1D and 3D simulations : it retains both horizontal and vertical dimensions, allowing a large number of atmospheric phenomena to be represented without the significant cost of a 3D simulation. 2D configurations are able to study free convection, thermals, gravity waves, 2D turbulence, ...

To perform a 2D simulation with Meso-NH you need to :ref:`prepare the initial condition <2d_prep_ideal_case>` and :ref:`run the model <2d_mesonh>` using the :ref:`prep_ideal_case` and :ref:`mesonh` executables respectively. These two steps are described in the following sections:

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1
   :backlinks: top

.. warning::

   This kind of simulation is not parallelized and can only be run on 1 core.

.. note::

   You can find all the namelists presented in this section as well as the scripts here:

   .. treeview::
   
      - :dir:`folder` |MNH_directory_extract_current|/MY_RUN/tutorials/ideal_cases/2D/
      
        - :dir:`folder` 001_prep_ideal_case : directory to :ref:`prepare the initial condition <2d_prep_ideal_case>`

        - :dir:`folder` 003_python : directory to :ref:`plot the figure <2d_plot>`

   The different steps must be performed in the order indicated by the directory numbers.

.. _2d_prep_ideal_case:

Prepare the initial condition (:ref:`prep_ideal_case`)
------------------------------------------------------------------

To create the initial condition for a 2D Meso-NH simulation you have to use :ref:`prep_ideal_case` program. This program reads a file called :file:`PRE_IDEA1.nam` defining the characteristics of the simulation.

.. tip::

   To see all the namelists you can use in the :ref:`prep_ideal_case` program or to obtain information about namelists, please go :ref:`here <executables_and_namelists>`.

In the :file:`PRE_IDEA1.nam` file, we recommend to have the following minimum informations and namelists:

* The name of the NetCDF files you will create with the :ref:`prep_ideal_case` program (without the extension) in :ref:`NAM_LUNITn <nam_lunitn>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_LUNITn CINIFILE    = "INI",
                 CINIFILEPGD = "PGD" /

  .. note::

     In this example, you will create the two NetCDF files :file:`INI.nc` and :file:`PGD.nc` corresponding respectively to initial and surface boundary conditions files.

* The number of points along x (i) and y (j) direction (it has to be 1 for one direction for 2D configuration) in :ref:`NAM_DIMn_PRE <nam_dimn_pre>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_DIMn_PRE NIMAX = 200,
                   NJMAX = 1 /

  .. note::

     In this example, you will have a x-z domain.

* The type of initial profile and the shape of the orography you will impose in :ref:`NAM_CONF_PRE <nam_conf_pre>` :

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_CONF_PRE CIDEAL = "RSOU",
                   CZS    = "BELL" /

  .. note::

     * In this example, you will use initialization from radiosounding (:code:`CIDEAL="RSOU"`) and bell-shape hill orography (:code:`CZS="BELL"`).
     
     * Characteristic of radiosounding has to be defined in the :ref:`freeformat part <freeformat_prep_ideal_case>` of the :file:`PRE_IDEA1.nam` file (cf below).
     
     * Characteristic of the bell-shape hill orography has to be defined in :ref:`NAM_GRIDH_PRE <nam_gridh_pre>` namelist. 

* The horizontal resolution along i and j direction and the orography charateristic in :ref:`NAM_GRIDH_PRE <nam_gridh_pre>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_GRIDH_PRE XDELTAX = 2000.,
                    XDELTAY = 2000.,
                    XHMAX   = 100.,
                    XAX     = 8000.,
                    NIZS    = 100 /

  .. note::

     It is better to set XDELTAX and XDELTAY to a value that is consistent with the relevant resolution of the your case study. XHMAX, XAX and NIZS correspond to characteristic of the bell-shape hill you've chose in :ref:`NAM_CONF_PRE <nam_conf_pre>` namelist.

* The vertical grid discretisation in :ref:`NAM_VER_GRID <nam_ver_grid>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_VER_GRID NKMAX  = 40,
                   ZDZGRD = 750.,
                   ZDZTOP = 750. /

  .. note::

     In this example, you will use 40 vertical grid points with a vertical resolution of 750 m everywhere.

* The kind of lateral boundary condition in :ref:`NAM_LBCn_PRE <nam_lbcn_pre>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_LBCn_PRE CLBCX(1) = "CYCL",
                   CLBCX(2) = "CYCL" /
                   
  .. note::

     In this example, you will use cyclic lateral boundary condition in :ref:`prep_ideal_case` to impose cyclic orography.

* The surface representation in :ref:`NAM_GRn_PRE <nam_grn_pre>` and :ref:`NAM_COVER <nam_cover>` namelists:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_GRn_PRE CSURF        = "EXTE" /
     &NAM_COVER XUNIF_COVER(4) =  1.0   /

  .. note::

     In this example, you will use SURFEX (:code:`CSURF = "EXTE"`) and a cover containing 100 % nature points (:code:`XUNIF_COVER(4) = 1.0`).

* The characteristic of the vertical profile is given in the :ref:`freeformat part <freeformat_prep_ideal_case>` of the :file:`PRE_IDEA1.nam` file:

  .. code:: fortran

     29900.0    390.68  0.0

  .. note::

     In this example you will impose an u-wind speed of 10 m/s, a relative humidty of 0 % (dry simulation) and a regular increase of the potential temperature from 288 K at 0 m to 390.68 K at 29900 m.
