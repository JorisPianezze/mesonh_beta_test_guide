One dimensional (single column z) with ideal surface
==================================================================

Some of the most important advantages to use one dimensional (or single column, 1D) atmospheric simulations are :

* **Simplicity :** simpler and require fewer computing resources than 2D or 3D models.

* **Study vertical processes and surface-atmosphere interactions :** focus on vertical processes in the atmosphere, such as convection, cloud formation, and heat and moisture exchange without the complexity of horizontal advection.

* **Parameterisation development and testing :** used to develop and test new physical parameterisations (e.g. for clouds, precipitation or radiation) before they are integrated into 2D or 3D models.

To perform a 1D simulation with Meso-NH you need to :ref:`prepare the initial condition <1d_prep_ideal_case>` and :ref:`run the model <1d_mesonh>` using the :ref:`prep_ideal_case` and :ref:`mesonh` executables respectively. These two steps are described in the following sections:

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1
   :backlinks: top

.. warning::

   This kind of simulation is not parallelized and can only be run on 1 core.

.. _1d_prep_ideal_case:

Prepare the initial condition (:ref:`prep_ideal_case`)
------------------------------------------------------------------

To create the initial condition for a vertical 1D Meso-NH simulation you have to use :ref:`prep_ideal_case` program. This program reads a file called :file:`PRE_IDEA1.nam` defining the characteristics of the simulation.

.. tip::

   To see all the namelists you can use in the :ref:`prep_ideal_case` program or to obtain information about namelists, please go :ref:`here <executables_and_namelists>`.

In the :file:`PRE_IDEA1.nam` file, we recommend to have the following minimum informations and namelists:

* The name of the NetCDF files you will create with the :ref:`prep_ideal_case` program (without the extension) in :ref:`NAM_LUNITn <nam_lunitn>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_LUNITn CINIFILE    = "INI",
                 CINIFILEPGD = "PGD" /

  .. note::

     In this example, you will create the two NetCDF files :file:`INI.nc` and :file:`PGD.nc` corresponding respectively to initial and surface boundary conditions files.

* The number of points along x (i) and y (j) direction (it has to be 1 in 1D configuration) in :ref:`NAM_DIMn_PRE <nam_dimn_pre>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_DIMn_PRE NIMAX = 1,
                   NJMAX = 1 /

* The horizontal resolution along i and j direction in :ref:`NAM_GRIDH_PRE <nam_gridh_pre>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_GRIDH_PRE XDELTAX = 1000.,
                    XDELTAY = 1000. /

  .. note::

     It is better to set XDELTAX and XDELTAY to a value that is consistent with the relevant resolution of the parameterization you are testing (at least 1000.0 (m), or even 50 000 (m) if climate applications are targeted).

* The vertical grid discretisation in :ref:`NAM_VER_GRID <nam_ver_grid>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_VER_GRID NKMAX  = 100,
                   ZDZGRD = 40.,
                   ZDZTOP = 40. /

  .. note::

     In this example, you will use 100 vertical grid points with a vertical resolution of 40 m everywhere.

* The surface representation in :ref:`NAM_GRn_PRE <nam_grn_pre>`, :ref:`NAM_PGD_SCHEMES <nam_pgd_schemes>` and :ref:`NAM_COVER <nam_cover>` namelists:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_GRn_PRE CSURF        = "EXTE" /
     &NAM_COVER XUNIF_COVER(1) =  1.0   /
     &NAM_PGD_SCHEMES CSEA     = "FLUX" /

  .. note::

     * In this example, you will use SURFEX (CSURF = "EXTE"), a cover containing 100 % sea points (XUNIF_COVER(1) = 1.0) and a prescribed ideal flux surface condition (CSEA = "FLUX").
   
     * The values of surface fluxes are given in the simulation namelist (see :ref:`simulation <1d_mesonh>` section).

* The type of initial profile you will impose in :ref:`NAM_CONF_PRE <nam_conf_pre>`:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_CONF_PRE CIDEAL = "RSOU" /

* The characteristic of the vertical profile is given in the :ref:`freeformat part <freeformat_prep_ideal_case>` of the :file:`PRE_IDEA1.nam` file:

  .. code:: fortran

     RSOU
     2025 6 11 0.

     4000.00     317.90  0.00

  .. note::

     In this example you will impose an horizontal wind speed of 0 m/s, a relative humidty of 0 % (dry simulation) and a constant potential temperature of 300 K from 0 m to 1000 m and then a regular increase of the potential temperature up to the top of the domain (4000 m).

Once you have put these namelist in the :file:`PRE_IDEA1.nam` file, you can launch :ref:`prep_ideal_case` program in the same directory as the :file:`PRE_IDEA1.nam` file (execution takes less than 2 s):

.. code-block:: bash
   :substitutions:

   source |MNH_directory_extract_current|/conf/profile_mesonh
   PREP_IDEAL_CASE${XYZ}

At the end of the :ref:`prep_ideal_case` execution, you need to have following files:

.. role:: gray
   :class: text-gray

.. treeview::

   - :dir:`folder` your_run_directory/

     - :dir:`file` PRE_IDEA1.nam :gray:`: The file you've created from this example`
     - :dir:`file` INI.des :gray:`: The descriptive part of the initial condition file`
     - :dir:`file` INI.nc :gray:`: The NetCDF part of the initial condition file`
     - :dir:`file` PGD.nc :gray:`: The NetCDF part of the physiographic data file`
     - :dir:`file` OUTPUT_LISTING1 :gray:`: File containing debug informations`

.. tip::

   To verify that the program has been executed correctly, you should see the following lines at the end of the :file:`OUTPUT_LISTING1` file:

   .. code-block:: bash

.. _1d_mesonh:

Launch the simulation (:ref:`mesonh`)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To launch the Meso-NH simulation you have to use :ref:`mesonh` program. This program reads a file called :file:`EXSEG1.nam` defining the characteristics of the simulation.

.. tip::

   To see all the namelists you can use in the :ref:`mesonh` program or to obtain information about namelists, please go :ref:`here <executables_and_namelists>`.

In the :file:`EXSEG1.nam` file, we recommend to have the following minimum informations and namelists:


* The name of the NetCDF files created by the :ref:`prep_ideal_case` program in :ref:`NAM_LUNITn <nam_lunitn>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_LUNITn CINIFILE    = "INI",
                 CINIFILEPGD = "PGD" /

* The simulated length (in s) and the activation of Coriolis effect in :ref:`NAM_DYN <nam_dyn>` namelist :

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_DYN XSEGLEN = 25200.0,
              LCORIO  = .FALSE. /

* The backup output writing period in :ref:`NAM_BACKUP <nam_backup>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_BACKUP XBAK_TIME(1,1) = 25200.0 /

* The time step and pressure solver option in :ref:`NAM_DYNn <nam_dynn>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_DYNn XTSTEP   = 10.0,
               CPRESOPT = "ZRESI" /

* The temporal and advection schemes in :ref:`NAM_ADVn <nam_advn>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_ADVn CTEMP_SCHEME    = "RKC4",
               CUVW_ADV_SCHEME = "CEN4TH",
               CMET_ADV_SCHEME = "PPM_01" /

* The physical parametrization options in :ref:`NAM_PARAMn <nam_paramn>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_PARAMn CTURB  = "TKEL",
                 CRAD   = "NONE",
                 CCLOUD = "NONE",

                 CDCONV = "NONE" /
                 
  .. note::

     In this example you will activate 1.5 order turbulence scheme (TKEL, :cite:t:`cuxart_turbulence_2000`) and shallow convection (EDKF, :cite:t:`pergaud_parameterization_2009`) parametrizations.

* The turbulence scheme option in :ref:`NAM_TURBn <nam_turbn>` namelist:

  .. code:: fortran
  
     &NAM_TURBn CTURBDIM="1DIM",
                CTURBLEN="RM17" /

  .. note::

     In this example you will use 1D version of the turbulence scheme and the mixing lentgh of :cite:t:`rodier_evaluation_2017`.

* The turbulence diagnostics in :ref:`NAM_LES <nam_les>`:

  .. code:: fortran
  
     &NAM_LES LLES_MEAN = .TRUE. /
     
  .. note::

     Only the mean variables are stored in this example.

* The shallow convection options in :ref:`NAM_PARAM_MFSHALLn <nam_param_mfshalln>`:

  .. code:: fortran
  
     &NAM_PARAM_MFSHALLn CMF_UPDRAFT = "EDKF",
                         LMIXUV      = .TRUE.,
                         LMF_FLX     = .TRUE. /

  .. note::

     You will chose to use EDKF parametrization (:code:`CMF_UPDRAFT = "EDKF"`), to activate wind mixing from thermal structures (:code:`LMIXUV = .TRUE.`) and to store the mass fluxes (:code:`LMF_FLX = .TRUE.`).


* The heat fluxes imposed at the surface boundary condition in :ref:`NAM_IDEAL_FLUX <nam_ideal_flux>`:

  .. code:: fortran

     &NAM_IDEAL_FLUX NFORCF    = 2,
                     XTIMEF(1) = 0.,
                     XTIMEF(2) = 25200.,
                     XSFTH(1)  = 200.0,
                     XSFTH(2)  = 200.0 /
                     
  .. note::

     In this example, you will force your simulation with surface constant heat flux of 200 W/m2 throughout the simulation.

                         XSFTH(2)  = 200.0 /

Once you have put these namelist in the :file:`EXSEG1.nam` file, you can launch :ref:`mesonh` program in the same directory as the :file:`EXSEG1.nam`, :file:`INI.des`, :file:`INI.nc` and :file:`PGD.nc` files (execution takes less than 15 s):

.. code-block:: bash
   :substitutions:

   source |MNH_directory_extract_current|/conf/profile_mesonh
   MESONH${XYZ}

At the end of the :ref:`mesonh` execution, you need to have following files:
