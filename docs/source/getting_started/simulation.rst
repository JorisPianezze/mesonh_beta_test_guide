Simulation
================================================

.. note::

   In Meso-NH, simulations can be divived in two categories:
   
   * "ideal cases" category where simulations are initialized with an idealized atmosphere, typically with a radiosonding
   
   * "real cases" category where simulations are initialized with large-scale 3d atmospheric fields (IFS, ARPEGE, AROME, GFS, etc.).

Both categories are described in subsections :
