Configuring the Meso-NH package
*****************************************************************************

For the installation process, you could now use the `./configure` script like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/MNH-V5-7-1/src
   ./configure
   . ../conf/profile_mesonh

This will create a configuration file `profile_mesonh` with an extension reflecting the different choices made automatically to match the computer on which you want to install Meso-NH.

.. warning::

  On GENCI, ECMWF, Meteo-France and some supercomputers, the './configure' script is tuned to identify the machine on which the command is run. For them, the compiler, MPI and netCDF libraries are automatically chosen.

  To install this version on one of these machines, go to go to Section XXX (COMPILING/INSTALLING ON GENCI & ECMWF & METEO COMPUTERS).

If you are installing Meso-NH on an unknown computer, to configure the Meso-NH package, there are 3 main environment variables that can be set:

- `ARCH`: the architecture to use (OS + compiler, default is `LXgfortran` for Linux with gfortran compiler)
- `VER_MPI`: the version of MPI to use (default is `MPIVIDE` for no parallel run)
- `OPTLEVEL`: the level of optimization for the compiler (default is `DEBUG` for development purpose, debugging and fast compilation)

If needed, you can change the default values of these environment variables. For example, if you want to use the Intel compiler `ifx`` with the Intel MPI library and an optimisation level of `-O2`, you can run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   export ARCH=LXifort
   export VER_MPI=MPIAUTO
   export OPTLEVEL=O2
   ./configure

Then, you have to source the generated file before compiling the code:

.. code-block:: bash
   . ../conf/profile_mesonh-LXifx-R8I4-MNH-V5-7-1-MPIINTEL-O2

.. note::

   - The options specific to the architecture and compiler such as `OPTLEVEL` are defined inside the `Rules.${ARCH}.mk` files.
   - The options specific to the MPI library (`VER_MPI`) are defined inside `Makefile.MESONH.mk` **is it correct? est-ce qu'il y a aussi des options pour les bibli dans les Rules?**
   - There are also options for the netCDF library (see the `VER_CDF` variable)
   - If needed, for adaptation to your requirements, look inside the files and changes options for your needs.
   - On a Linux PC, if you need to compile the MPI library, look at the "MesonhTEAM Wiki" to know `how to compile the OpenMPI library with MESONH <http://mesonh.aero.obs-mip.fr/mesonh57/MesonhTEAMFAQ/PC_Linux>`_ **A remplacer par un nouveau lien, texte pas Ã  jour**
