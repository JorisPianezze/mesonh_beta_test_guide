Meso-NH offers a wide range of online diagnostics for horizontally averaged mean quantities, turbulence (resolved and sub-grid contributions), 
averaged quantities over updraf and downdraft, or 2-point correlations quantities.
The averaging is done over the whole domain or a box (see :ref:`nam_les`).  

All available variables can be found here :download:`here <online_turbulent_diagnostics.pdf>`.
They are activated with
