* :code:`XTS_WATER_UNIF` : uniform prescribed value of water surface temperature supposed at an altitude of 0m (mean sea level altitude). The temperature is then modified for each point depending on its altitude, following a uniform vertical gradient of -6.5 K km-1. This prescribed value, if defined, has priority on the use of CFILE_WATFLX data.

* :code:`CFILE_WATFLX` / :code:`CFILEPGD_WATFLX` : name of the PREP / PGD files used to define the Sea surface Temperature. The use of a file or prescribed value XTS_WATER_UNIF has priority on the data in CFILE_WATFLX file.

* :code:`CTYPE` / :code:`CTYPEPGD` : type of the CFILE_WATFLX / CFILEPGD_WATFLX file, if the latter is provided. CTYPE / CTYPEPGD must then be given. The following values are currently usable:

   * "MESONH": the file type is a MESONH file.
   
   * "GRIB": the file type is a GRIB file, coming from any of these models:

     * "ECMWF ": european center forecast model
     * "ARPEGE": Arpege french forecast model
     * "AROME": AROME french forecast local model
     * "MOCAGE": Mocage french research chemistry model

   * "ASCII ": PREP / PGD Surfex ASCII file

   * "LFI ": PREP/PGD Surfex LFI file
   
* :code:`NYEAR` : year of surface UTC time. It is used only if no atmospheric file or no surface file is given (in those the date can be read).

* :code:`NMONTH` : month of surface UTC time. It is used only if no atmospheric file or no surface file is given (in those the date can be read).

* :code:`NDAY` : day of surface UTC time. It is used only if no atmospheric file or no surface file is given (in those the date can be read).

* :code:`XTIME` : time from midnight of surface UTC time (seconds). It is used only if no atmospheric file or no surface file is given (in those the date can be read). 

* :code:`LWAT_SBL` : activates surface boundary multi layer scheme over inland water.
