* :code:`LIBM` : Flag to activate Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) or not. CAUTION: In their current version, IBM can only be used in combination with flat terrain (LFLAT=.TRUE.), cartesian coordinates (LCARTESIAN=.TRUE.), and near-neutral atmospheric conditions. It is furthermore recommended to use IBM in combination with the WENO5 or WENO3 momentum advection scheme.

  * .TRUE.: Immersed Boundary Method is activated.
  * .FALSE.: Immersed Boundary Method is not activated.

* :code:`LIBM_TROUBLE` : Flag to deal with too small obstacles or too small space in between obstacles (underresolved obstacles). Recommended is to filter the  obstacles during the preprocessing and not to use LIBM_TROUBLE=.TRUE..

  * .TRUE.: Flag to deal with too small obstacles is activated.

  * 'FORCIN': Forcing - The ghost cell technique is used at all intermediate time steps of the Runge Kutta scheme.
