NAM_PROFILERn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This namelist is used to configure virtual vertical profilers by using the following described parameters or a .csv file. Calculations are done for all the nested models for which the namelist is provided and recorded in the corresponding diachronic files. Before the version 5.6 of MesoNH, this was done by modifying :file:`ini_profilern.f90` and re-compiling the code.

* :code:`NNUMB_PROF` : number of profilers. Limited to 100 if not using a .csv file.

* :code:`XSTEP_PROF` : time (in seconds) between two sampling written in the diachronic file

* :code:`XX_PROF` : X-position (in meters) of the profiler in the cartesian coordinates (with LCARTESIAN=T only)

* :code:`XY_PROF` : Y-position (in meters) of the profiler in the cartesian coordinates (with LCARTESIAN=T only)

* :code:`XLAT_PROF` : latitude (in degrees) of the profiler (with LCARTESIAN=F only)

* :code:`XLON_PROF` : longitude (in degrees) of the profiler (with LCARTESIAN=F only)

* :code:`XZ_PROF` : height above the model orography (in meters) of the profiler

* :code:`CNAME_PROF` : name of the profiler

* :code:`CFILE_PROF` : name of the .csv file containing the definition of the profilers (see below). If CFILE_PROF='NO_INPUT_CSV', the .csv file is not read.

* :code:`LDIAG_SURFRAD` : if True, the surface and radiation variables are written. You must also set N2M=2 in :ref:`nam_diag_surfn` for a correct saving of SURFEX variables.

.. note::

   If a .csv file is provided, coordinates given in the namelist will be ignored. The .csv file should follow the format example hereafter:
   
   .. code-block::

      Name, X[m]/Lat[deg], Y[m]/Lon[deg], Z[m]
      prof1, 50.0,  50.0, 10.0
      prof2, 50.0,   1.0, 11.25
      prof3, 350.0, 50.0, 10.0

   The values of X,Y or Lat/Lon are read depending on LCARTESIAN.
