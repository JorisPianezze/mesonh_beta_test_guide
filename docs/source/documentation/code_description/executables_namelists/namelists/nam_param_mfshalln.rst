NAM_PARAM_MFSHALLn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It contains the options retained for the EDKF shallow convection scheme, used by the model n. They are included in the declarative module MODD_PARAM_MFSHALLn. Contrary to the KAFR scheme, EDKF can only be called  every time step.
