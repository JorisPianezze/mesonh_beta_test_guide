NAM_HURR_CONF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two :program:`PREP_REAL_CASE` jobs are to be performed. In a mono-model configuration, the first job allows to remove analysed hurricane from the input GRIB fields: filtered and interpolated fields are written in a MesoNH file.
It is used as input file for the second PREP_REAL_CASE job during which the analytical vortex is added.

Each step (hurricane filtering and vortex bogussing) is separately invoked within the :program:`PREP_REAL_CASE` program:

* The hurricane filtering is applied on four input atmospheric GRIB fields (HATMFILETYPE='GRIBEX'), when they are in the horizontal grid of the PGD file and in the vertical grid of the GRIB file. The input atmospheric GRIB fields filtered are the two horizontal components of wind, the absolute temperature, the humidity  and the surface pressure reduced to ground level. Each field is decomposed  into three parts: first, the BASic part is computed by the low-pass Barnes filter; then the hurricane (symmetric) disturbance is computed from the  remainder disturbance part. The initial fields are then remplaced by their ENVironmental part: total field minus hurricane disturbance part.

* The vortex bogussing consists on a symmetric vortex added to the input atmospheric Meso-NH fields (HATMFILETYPE='MESONH'). The tangential wind is computed from an analytical formulation (Holland, 1980): Mercator projection must be used to respect hypotheses of Holland. Then, the balanced mass field is deduced from the thermal wind relation. The bogus of the two horizontal components of wind and the potential temperature is added to the initial (filtered) fields.

For a grid-nesting simulation, the hurricane filtering is first applied for the outer domain (dad model), with the program :program:`PREP_REAL_CASE`. The filtered fields are then horizontally interpolated for inner domains with the program :ref:`spawning`. Then, for each inner domain, a vortex bogussing is added with the program :program:`PREP_REAL_CASE`.

* :code:`LFILTERING` : Flag to filter the fields (U,V,T,Q,reduced Ps) of the atmospheric file

* :code:`CFILTERING` : to choose the fields to be filtered (U,V,T,reduced Ps).

  * 'UVT' : U,V,T are filtered (default),
  * 'UVTQ' : U,V,T,Q are filtered (default),
  * 'UVTP' : U,V,T and reduced PS are filtered,
  * 'UVTPQ' : U,V,T,Q and reduced PS are filtered,

* :code:`XBOXWIND` : half-width of the box inside which the dynamical center is searched from the guessed position (km)

* :code:`XRADGUESS` : guess  of the radius of the domain in which the cyclone will be filtered (km)

* :code:`NPHIL` : number of azimuthal directions used for the cylindrical coordinates

* :code:`NDIAG_FILT` : allows storage of several components calculated from total fields. Be careful, the components are on the GRIB vertical grid. Then to visualize all the GRIB vertical levels, the number of MesoNH vertical levels must be equal or greater than the number of levels in the input GRIB file.

The program will check that CDADATMFILE and CDADBOGFILE have the same  characteristics, before replacing the dad name of CINIFILE by CDADBOGFILE instead of CDADATMFILE. CDADBOGFILE must exist before running the PREP_REAL_CASE job.
