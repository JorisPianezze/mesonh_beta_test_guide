* :code:`LBLOWSNOW` : Flag to active pronostic blowing snow 

* :code:`NBLOWSNOW3D` : Number of blowing snow variables as scalar in Meso-NH. The curent version of the model use two scalars: number concentration and mass concentration (kg/kg)

* :code:`NBLOWSNOW_2D` :  Number of 2D blowing snow variables advected in Meso-NH. The curent version of the model advectes three variables: total number concentration in Canopy, total mass concentration in Canopy and equivalent concentration in the saltation layer

* :code:`XALPHA_SNOW` : Gamma distribution shape factor

* :code:`XRSNOW` : Ratio between diffusion coefficient for scalar variables and blowing snow variables

  * XRSNOW = KSCA/KSNOW = 4. (if Redelsperger-Sommeria (1981) used in :file:`ini_cturb.f90`)
  * XRSNOW = KSCA/KSNOW = 2.5 ( if Cheng-Canuto-Howard (2002) used in :file:`ini_cturb.f90`)
